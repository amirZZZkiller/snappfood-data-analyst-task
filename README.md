# Snappfood Data Analyst Task

This repository contains my solutions to the Snappfood Data Analyst technical assessment. The project addresses four real-world problems across clustering, predictive modeling, image data validation, and SQL-based business analytics.

Each task is implemented using Python and industry-standard libraries, with emphasis on clean code, insightful reporting, and business relevance.
