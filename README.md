# Snappfood Data Analyst Task

This repository contains my solutions to the Snappfood Data Analyst technical assessment. The project addresses four real-world business problems across clustering, predictive modeling, image data validation, and SQL-based vendor analysis.

Each completed task emphasizes clarity, analytical rigor, and professional reporting. Solutions are modular and documented, with clean datasets, reproducible outputs, and structured reports.

## 📁 Project Structure

snappfood-data-analyst-task/<br>
├── task 1 - restaurant assignment/ # ✅ Clustering restaurants among 5 agents<br>
├── task 2 - grading model/ # ✅ Predictive modeling for restaurant grading<br>
├── task 3 - ocr verification/ # ⚠️ OCR pipeline implemented with EasyOCR, but needs further work<br>
└── task 4 - sql analysis/ # ✅ SQL-based vendor revenue, profit, and AOV analysis<br>

## ✅ Task Status Summary

- **Task 1:** Completed using Python (scikit-learn, networkx). Includes full evaluation and report.
- **Task 2:** Completed with modeling pipeline, SMOTE, and cross-validation. Final model: Random Forest.
- **Task 3:** Implemented a full OCR pipeline using EasyOCR and OpenCV. While results were limited due to signage complexity, the pipeline is functional and documented.
- **Task 4:** Completed in pure SQL using DB Browser for SQLite. Includes queries, `.db` file, `.csv` results, and a structured report.

## 🚀 How to Run

Each task folder contains:
- Core analysis code (`.ipynb` for Tasks 1–2, `.sql` for Task 4)
- Exported results (`.csv`)
- Formal task reports (`.pdf`)
- Final model or database artifacts (e.g., `.pkl`, `.db`)

**For Task 4**:
- Open `task4_database.db` using DB Browser for SQLite
- All queries are saved in `task4_queries.sql`
- Outputs exported as CSV for reuse or reporting

## 📄 Reports

Each task contains a standalone report documenting:
- Objectives
- Methodology
- Evaluation
- Results & Deliverables
- Final Insights

Reports are located in each task directory as `taskN_report.pdf`.
